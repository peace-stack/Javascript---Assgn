<h3> Questions </h3>
<ol>
        <li> Write a function that takes a number, if the number is odd, then multiply the number by three and add one; otherwise, divide it by two and subtract one </li>
        <li>
            Write a program to console.log() a number between 1 and 100 that is divisible by 3 </li>
        <li> Write a function a function to calculate the difference in year from 1970 and 2023 </li>
        <li>a. Given two numbers print 1 if one of them is divisible by the other one, otherwise print 0. (use functions)
        b. Given two numbers print 1 if both of them is divisible by two, otherwise print 0. (use functions)
            </li>
        <li>a. Using the object constructor, declare an object, and assign the following properties to it, name, gender, course of study and institution, using an value of your choice. Then use template literals to form a sentence and log it to the console. 
    b. Using object literals, declare an object with three properties,and assign any number value to them. In the object, have a method called “firstFunc”, that adds the first two properties and subtract the third. Have another method called “secondFunc” multiply the last two properties and add the first one. Take note of BODMAS principle in your mathematical operation.</li>
